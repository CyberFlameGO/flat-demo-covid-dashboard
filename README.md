# Flat Data Demo: COVID Dashboard

This demo is part of a larger Flat Data project created by Github Research. Read more about it [here](https://octo.github.com/blog/flat-data).

## What this demo does

This uses a Flat Action to fetch data about COVID-19 and display it in a dashboard. It's a great example of how to:

- load data from different sources (both HTTP & SQL)

- merge that data into one `data.json` file

- create a dashboard on top of that data
